# MinewaysTextureFixer
A python script for blender to change all nodes from Mineways materials to closest filter type and connect all alphas.
#
This is patched together from [this hilighted youtube comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSfX4ZqP92A&lc=Ugw90Cf07jL79-IQtQZ4AaABAg) and [Ron Jensen's comment](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/239854/using-python-to-batch-link-image-texture-alpha-to-principled-bsdf/239948#comments-239854) on my stackexchange post.

You may also want to try modifying Marty Fouts script on that same post if the nodes are set up different than normal, as his is less prone to messing up when things are not how they were when I made this.
