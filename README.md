# MinewaysTextureFixer
A python script for blender to change all nodes from Mineways materials to closest filter type and connect all alphas. It can also swap out all of the image texture files by filling out and uncommenting line 28.

For blender 2.93 and later!

This is patched together from [this hilighted youtube comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSfX4ZqP92A&lc=Ugw90Cf07jL79-IQtQZ4AaABAg) and [Ron Jensen's comment](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/239854/using-python-to-batch-link-image-texture-alpha-to-principled-bsdf/239948#comments-239854) on my stackexchange post.

You may also want to try modifying the script in Marty Fouts answer on that same post if the nodes are set up different than normal, as his is less prone to messing up (if things are not how they were when I made this.)
